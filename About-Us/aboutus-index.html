                <p class="about-us-content">Prayas is the official social welfare society of NSUT, Delhi. A Delhi Govt.
                    recognized project for
                    giving educational support to underprivileged kids living near the NSUT campus. We hold workshops
                    for slum children, organize collection drives, spread awareness about society's problems, interact
                    with the poor, and provide technical solutions to them. Bit by bit, 'The Neighbourhood Project' has
                    touched upon many lives in the past and will continue to do so in the future!

                <p class="vision-content">
                    Every single step with the right motive in the right direction leads to significant differences.
                    With this vision in our eyes and the earnest desire to address these issues gripping our society, we
                    wanted to get the answers to the endless debates our own way! In the neighborhood project, through
                    our small endeavors, we search for the answers to these questions.
